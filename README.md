## Introduction

This document contains the list of technologies, frameworks, and approaches that can be used to implement **Gamepad Navigator**.

## Factors to be Considered

Each of the available technologies has its advantages and disadvantages, and there's a general tendency to prefer the one with more benefits. But a good approach is to choose the technology according to our requirements and the scope of the project.

So, the factors that should be considered for selecting the candidate technology are:

1. Community's adaptability and familiarity with the technology.
2. Fulfillment of the project's requirements:
   - Accept and read inputs from the gamepad.
   - Relay functional code/script into the browser.
   - Compatible across multiple platforms and devices.
3. Stability and long-term support for the technology.
4. Provide assistance in implementing navigation features.

## Candidate Technologies

Before searching for a technology, I framed multiple approaches using which project requirements can be fulfilled. With those approaches in mind, I searched and looked through various technologies. Below is the list of the shortlisted ones:

1. Custom Browser Extension / Add-on
   - [Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions)
   - [Firefox Add-on](https://extensionworkshop.com/)
   - [Safari Extension](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html)
2. Electron.js Desktop App with the following Node.js packages:
   - [Node Key Sender](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-key-sender) or [Robot.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/robotjs)
   - [Gamepad](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gamepad) (Alternative to Gamepad API for Node.js)
3. [Espruino Pico](https://www.espruino.com/USB)
4. Secondary Extensions to inject Scripts
   - [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (For Safari and Chromium-based browsers)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (for Firefox)
5. [Bookmarklets](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarklets-perform-common-web-page-tasks)

## Analysis

### Custom Browser Extension / Add-on

This option would involve creating our browser extension (or add-on) that will enable the users to navigate using the gamepad.

#### Advantages

- Stable and long-term support.
- Based on JavaScript and can support Infusion.
- Provides various Chrome APIs which would be useful in implementing certain navigation effects/features.
- Lightweight and easy for user to set-up (and install).
- Requires no separate execution of scripts by the user.
- Can run on both Desktop and Mobile (supported for a few browsers only).

#### Disadvantages

- Cross-browser restrictions i.e., a Chrome-basesd extension can't run on Firefox or vice-versa.

Most of the browsers (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, etc.) are based on Chromium and can thus run Chrome Extension.The Chromium-based browsers for mobile such as [Kiwi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_IN) also support and allow users to install and run Chrome Extensions (unlike the Google Chrome for mobile).

Although a Firefox add-on would offer the same support and features, it will only be limited to Firefox. Talking about Safari add-ons, it would be accessible only to Apple users, as Safari runs only on macOS and iOS.

A Chrome extension would be accessible to a wide range of users, and so I believe that a Chrome Extension would be better than a Firefox or Safari add-on, if we choose to proceed with this option. The Chrome Extension can be ported to Firefox and Safari later in the future.

### Electron.js Desktop App

This would involve making a desktop app that can work at OS level.

#### Advantages

- Stable and long-term support.
- OS-level execution of actions.
- Simulate keyboard as well as mouse events.
- Based on JavaScript and can support Infusion.
- Easy for user to set-up (and install).
- Requires no separate execution of scripts by the user.

#### Disadvantages

- No support for devices other than a desktop or a PC.
- ([Node Key Sender](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-key-sender)) Requires a separate Java Environment in the OS to work.
- ([Robot.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/robotjs)) No stable release yet.
- Large size (> 100mb) and resource hogging.

This solution would offer more control to the users, in terms of navigation. The major limitations would be that it won't work on a mobile and will consume high amount of resources. Also, a few solutions already exist which offer the users to navigate at OS-level using a gamepad.

### Espruino Pico

This is a bit different approach. As of now, we want to have browser navigation using gamepad. But we can achieve similar results using an Internet of Things (IoT) board. Espruino Pico is one such IoT board that can be used both as a keyboard and a mouse.

#### Advantages

- Based on JavaScript.
- OS-level execution of actions.
- Simulate keyboard as well as mouse events.
- Requires no separate execution of scripts by the user.
- Low cost (under $50).

#### Disadvantages

- Requires a lot of technical setup and integration by the user.
- Cannot use Infusion due to memory limitations.
- Might require additional hardware (buttons, switches, pins, etc.) to work.
- Can be easily damaged or destroyed (bricked) by the user.
- Requires knowledge from the user to debug or fix, if damaged (bricked).
- Less flexible in terms of reconfiguration.    <!-- Swap hardware, buttons, etc. -->

Although this is a low-cost solution, it seems unconvenient to me, both as a developer and an user. This would require too much of technical setup and integration and a decent knowledge of IoT Boards. The users might feel overwhelmed.

### Secondary Extensions / Add-ons

There are some extensions or add-ons that can inject our code (scripts) into the webpages. Some of the popular ones are [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (For Safari and Chromium-based browsers) and [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (for Firefox).

#### Advantages

- Based on JavaScript and can support Infusion.
- Can run on both Desktop and Mobile (supported for a few browsers only).

#### Disadvantages

- Requires setting-up and loading the scripts separately by the user.
- Limitations in regards to a few navigation features ot effects.
- More dependent on technology.
- Sometimes load potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and malware in the background.
- Contains some potential bugs that can hamper the user experience.
- Less flexible in terms of reconfiguration.

### Bookmarklets

A bookmarklet is a bookmark tab that injects script into the current webpage when pressed. The bookmark tab must be linked to the script that we want to inject and the script must be hosted on the web.

#### Advantages

- Based on JavaScript and can support Infusion.
- Requires no additional software/hardware to install and set-up.
- Can run on both Desktop and Mobile.
- Supported by all the browsers.

#### Disadvantages

- Requires the user to set-up the bookmarklet manually.
- Requires executing manually everytime the webpage is updated, reloaded or a new tab or browser window is opened.
- Limitations in regards to a few navigation features ot effects.
- Less flexible in terms of reconfiguration.

## Conclusion

I propose to use a Chrome Extension or an Electron.js App for the project. Espruino Pico is also a potential candidate, but the former two seem to be a better option.
